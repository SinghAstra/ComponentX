# Welcome to ComponentX

The primary purpose of this library is to create a single source of truth for all UI components. This ensures visual and functional consistency across our applications. Our vision is to establish a shared design language and streamline development workflows, making it easier for teams to build high-quality, scalable, and maintainable products. By using these components, developers can adhere to design standards without manual checks, reducing design debt and improving collaboration between design and development teams.

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center">
  <Button
    variant="ghost"
    className="hover:bg-transparent md:hidden"
    onClick={() => setIsSidebarOpen(!isSidebarOpen)}
  >
    <Menu />
  </Button>

```

Our library is built on a set of core principles to ensure its long-term success and usability. These principles guide our decision-making and component development:

- Consistency: All components should maintain a consistent look, feel, and behavior. This includes visual styling, naming conventions, and API design.
- Reusability: Components must be generic enough to be used in various contexts without modification. They should be "agnostic" to the specific business logic of any single application.
- Accessibility: All components are built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. This ensures our applications are usable by a wide range of people, including those with disabilities.
- Maintainability: The codebase is well-documented, tested, and organized. This makes it easy for new developers to understand and contribute to the library.
- Performance: Components are optimized for performance to ensure they don't negatively impact application load times or rendering speed.

## How to Get Started

To begin using this library, follow these simple steps.

1.  Installation: Install the library in your project using a package manager.

    ```bash
    npm install @your-organization/component-library
    ```

2.  Importing Components: Import the desired components into your application files.

    ```jsx
    import { Button, Card } from "@your-organization/component-library";
    ```

3.  Usage: Use the components in your JSX or HTML code.

    ```jsx
    <button variant="primary" onClick="{handleLogin}">Log In</button>
    <Card>
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>This is a sample card component.</p>
    </Card>
    ```

## Project Structure

The library's file structure is organized to be intuitive and easy to navigate.

```
/src
├── /components
│   ├── /Button
│   │   ├── Button.js
│   │   ├── Button.stories.js
│   │   └── Button.test.js
│   ├── /Card
│   │   ├── Card.js
│   │   ├── Card.stories.js
│   │   └── Card.test.js
│   └── index.js
├── /styles
│   └── variables.scss
└── index.js
```

- `src/components`: Contains individual folders for each component.
- `src/components/Button`: Each component folder includes the component file (`.js`), a Storybook file (`.stories.js`) for documentation, and a test file (`.test.js`).
- `src/styles`: Holds global styles, such as design tokens and variables.
- `index.js`: Exports all components, making them easily accessible.
