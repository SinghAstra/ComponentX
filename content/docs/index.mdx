title: Introduction
description: Trying to design components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.
---

When working on my personal projects, I often found myself rewriting the same components repeatedly.
This collection of components is designed to make them reusable, helping me save time and effort.
It is built using Shadcn.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs.
The code is yours.

    Let’s call it inspiration to keep it subtle. I studied the open-source code
    of Shadcn and created this as my own simplified and personalized version of
    it.
